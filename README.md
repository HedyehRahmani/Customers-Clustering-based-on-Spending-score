## Introduction

Clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning technique that allows us to group data points into clusters based on their features. In this project, we focus on customer segmentation for a mall, where the goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information.

## Project Scope

Malls are often engaged in the race to increase their customer base and drive sales. To achieve this, machine learning is increasingly being applied to customer data to optimize marketing strategies. This project involves developing a clustering model to segment customers into meaningful groups, enabling targeted marketing efforts.

### Your Role

In this project, you assume the role of a data scientist working for a mall. You are provided with customer data, and your task is to segment the customers into various groups based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. These segments will help the mall's marketing team to target the right audience with the right products.

### Goal

The primary goal of this project is to build an unsupervised clustering model that accurately segments customers into distinct groups. The success of the model will be evaluated based on how well the clusters represent different customer behaviors and demographics.

### Specifics

- **Machine Learning Task:** Clustering model
- **Target Variable:** N/A (unsupervised learning)
- **Input Variables:** Customer demographic and behavioral data
- **Success Criteria:** Evaluated through cluster analysis and visualization

This repository serves as an educational resource for those looking to understand the fundamentals of clustering and customer segmentation, as well as a template for more complex unsupervised learning tasks.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Run the Python scripts to load the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

   ```bash
   python data_preparation.py
   python train_model.py
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Modeling Process

### Data Preparation

The dataset is loaded, and basic preprocessing steps are performed, including handling missing values, scaling features, and exploring the data through visualizations.

### Clustering Model

The project demonstrates how to:

- Set up and train a clustering model using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like silhouette score and visualizations like elbow plots.

## Results

After training the model, the scripts provide an analysis of the clusters, including visualizations of the customer groups and insights into their characteristics.
